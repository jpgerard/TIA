# Streamlit Cloud Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides steps to troubleshoot and resolve the blank screen issue with Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## Changes Made to Fix Blank Screen Issues

We've made several changes to address the blank screen issue:

1. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Updated Streamlit to version 1.28.0 (a more stable version)
   - Specified exact versions for all dependencies
   - Added additional dependencies that might be needed (protobuf, pydeck, pyarrow)

2. **Added Configuration Files**:
   - Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with optimized settings
   - Added `runtime.txt` to specify Python 3.10
   - Added `packages.txt` for system dependencies

3. **Code Improvements**:
   - Implemented forms for input handling
   - Added keys to all input elements
   - Fixed container type switching issues
   - Enhanced error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Find your app and click "Reboot app"
   - Wait for the app to redeploy (this may take a few minutes)

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - If the issue persists, check the logs in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Look for any error messages or warnings

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If the issue persists after the changes above, try these additional steps:

### 1. Check Browser Console

- Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
- Go to the Console tab
- Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings
- Take screenshots of any errors you find

### 2. Try Different Browsers

- Test the app in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode to rule out cache issues

### 3. Check Network Requests

- In the browser's developer tools, go to the Network tab
- Reload the page and look for any failed requests
- Check if the WebSocket connection is established

### 4. Simplify the App Further

If needed, you can temporarily simplify the app even more:

- Comment out sections of the app one by one to identify problematic components
- Remove any complex UI elements or interactions
- Test with minimal functionality

### 5. Contact Streamlit Support

If all else fails, contact Streamlit support with:

- A link to your GitHub repository
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Steps you've taken to troubleshoot
- Browser and OS information

## Debugging Tips

- Add `st.write(st.session_state)` to display the current session state

- Add `import logging; logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` at the top of your app
- Use `st.error()` to display error messages prominently
