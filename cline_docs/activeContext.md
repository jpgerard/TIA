# TariffDoc AI - Active Context

## Current Work

We have prepared the TariffDoc AI application for deployment to Streamlit Cloud. The application has been pushed to a GitHub repository at https://github.com/jpgerard/TIA and is ready to be deployed to Streamlit Cloud. We've created a streamlit_app.py file that serves as the entry point for Streamlit Cloud and added deployment instructions in STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md.

Previously, we were testing the Streamlit proof-of-concept (POC) application for TariffDoc AI and fixing issues discovered during testing. We identified and fixed a search functionality issue where certain hyphenated terms were not being properly handled, resulting in irrelevant search results. We've also addressed a more fundamental issue with the search results table not displaying relevant results for automotive bumper parts.

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Search Functionality Issues**:
   - Modified the `_get_fallback_results` method in `utils/api_client.py` to properly handle hyphenated terms by preprocessing the query to replace hyphens with spaces before checking for keywords.
   - Added debugging output to help diagnose similar issues in the future.
   - Fixed the condition to check for both hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions of terms.

2. **Improved LLM Service Validation**:
   - Fixed two places in `utils/product_analyzer.py` where the code was checking if the LLM service exists but not if it's enabled:
     - In the `_get_search_terms` method
     - In the `generate_tariff_explanation` method
   - Added proper validation to ensure the LLM service is only used when properly enabled.

3. **Enhanced LLM Integration for Product Classification**:
   - Modified the `enhance_search_query` method in `utils/llm_service.py` to ask the LLM to identify appropriate HTS codes for products.
   - Updated the prompt to include a new section: "HTS_CODES: Provide 2-3 specific HTS codes that would be appropriate for this product".
   - Added code to parse the HTS codes from the LLM response and include them in the search terms.
   - Removed hardcoded product category detection in favor of using the LLM to identify product categories and suggest appropriate HTS codes.
   - This approach is more general and can handle a wider range of products without hardcoding specific terms and codes.

4. **Added Relevance Filtering for Search Results**:
   - Implemented a new `_filter_results_for_relevance` method in `utils/product_analyzer.py` to filter out irrelevant search results.
   - The method calculates a relevance score based on how well the result matches the product description and search terms.
   - Specifically excluded results with HTS codes that start with "0102" (livestock) to prevent irrelevant livestock-related results.
   - Updated the `_sort_results` method to take into account the relevance score when sorting the results.

5. **Created Test Scripts**:
   - Developed test scripts to verify the fixes:
     - `simple_test.py`: Tests the original and fixed conditions for the search query.
     - `simple_test_focused.py`: Tests specifically how hyphenated terms are handled.
     - `test_api_url.py`: Shows how different query formats would be processed for API search.
     - `simple_bumper_test.py`: Tests the condition for bumper parts in the `_get_fallback_results` method.
     - `test_bumper_search.py`: Tests the full search process for "Packing-less bumper retainer".

## Specific Issues

1. **Hyphenated Terms Issue (Fixed)**:
   - We fixed an issue where searching for "Packing-less bumper retainer" was returning irrelevant livestock-related results (HTS codes like 0102.29.20.11) instead of the expected automotive parts results.
   - The issue was caused by the hyphen in "Packing-less" preventing the condition for automotive parts from matching, and potential improper use of the LLM service when it wasn't properly enabled.
   - With our fixes, the search now correctly handles hyphenated terms.

2. **Search Results Table Issue (Fixed)**:
   - We identified and fixed an issue where the search results table wasn't displaying relevant results for automotive bumper parts.
   - The issue was that the API search wasn't including the specific HTS code for automotive bumper parts.
   - We modified the LLM service to identify appropriate HTS codes for products and include them in the search terms.
   - This ensures that searches like "Packing-less bumper retainer" will return the appropriate automotive bumper parts results (8708.10.60) instead of irrelevant livestock-related results.
   - The solution is more general and can handle a wider range of products without hardcoding specific terms and codes.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Follow the instructions in STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md to deploy the application to Streamlit Cloud.
   - Configure the necessary environment variables for LLM features (if desired).
   - Test the deployed application to ensure it works correctly.

2. **Test the Deployed Application**:
   - Verify that all features work correctly in the deployed environment.
   - Test the search functionality with various product descriptions, including those with hyphens.
   - Test with and without the LLM service enabled to ensure both scenarios work correctly.
   - Verify that automotive bumper-related searches return the appropriate HTS codes (8708.10.60).

3. **Document Deployment Results**:
   - Update the progress.md file with deployment status and any issues encountered.
   - Note any differences between the local and deployed environments.

4. **Consider Additional Improvements**:
   - Enhance error handling for API failures.
   - Improve the fallback mechanism to provide more relevant results.
   - Add more comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues.
   - Consider adding unit tests for critical functionality.
   - Implement user authentication for the deployed application.
   - Add monitoring and analytics to track usage patterns.

The application has been improved to handle different query formats, properly validate the LLM service, and use the LLM to identify product categories and suggest appropriate HTS codes. These changes should provide a better user experience with more relevant search results.
