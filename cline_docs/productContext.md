# TariffDoc AI - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

TariffDoc AI was created to streamline the complex process of tariff classification and documentation for global manufacturing and import/export operations. The project addresses the challenges faced by businesses when navigating the complex world of international trade tariffs and compliance.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Tariff Classification Complexity**: The Harmonized Tariff Schedule contains thousands of product classifications with specific codes. Finding the correct classification is time-consuming and error-prone. TariffDoc AI simplifies this process with intelligent search capabilities.

2. **Trade Agreement Navigation**: Understanding which trade agreements apply to specific products and countries is challenging. The application identifies eligible trade agreements and potential duty savings automatically.

3. **Documentation Burden**: Creating compliant tariff documentation is labor-intensive. TariffDoc AI generates professional, compliance-ready PDF documents with all necessary tariff information.

4. **Expertise Gap**: Many businesses lack in-house tariff expertise. The application provides AI-generated explanations of tariff implications in plain language.

5. **Consistency Issues**: Manual tariff classification can lead to inconsistencies. The application ensures consistent classification across similar products.

## How It Should Work

1. **User Input**: Users enter a product description and select the country of origin and destination country.

2. **Intelligent Search**: The system searches for appropriate HTS codes using the USITC Harmonized Tariff Schedule data. When LLM features are enabled, the search is enhanced with AI-powered query enhancement.

3. **Results Display**: The system displays potential HTS codes with descriptions, applicable rates, and confidence levels (when LLM is enabled).

4. **Selection**: Users select the most appropriate HTS code for their product.

5. **Document Generation**: The system generates a comprehensive tariff document including:
   - Product and HTS code information
   - Applicable duty rates
   - Trade agreement eligibility
   - Expert analysis (when LLM is enabled)

6. **PDF Download**: Users can download a professional PDF document for compliance and record-keeping purposes.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal technical knowledge while providing powerful tariff intelligence capabilities. It serves as a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to simplify complex regulatory processes.
