## Current Testing Status

The application is currently in the testing phase. We are verifying:

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Application startup
   - Navigation between tabs
   - Form inputs and validation

2. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Basic search functionality
   - LLM-enhanced search (when enabled)
   - Results display and sorting
   - Handling of hyphenated terms and special characters
   - Relevance filtering of search results
   - LLM-based product classification and HTS code suggestion

3. **Document Generation**:
   - PDF creation
   - Content accuracy
   - Download functionality

4. **Integration Points**:
   - API communication
   - LLM service interaction
   - Data flow between components

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Search Functionality Issues (Fixed)**:
   - **Problem**: Searching for "Packing-less bumper retainer" returned irrelevant livestock-related results (HTS codes like 0102.29.20.11) instead of automotive parts.
   - **Root Cause**: The hyphen in "Packing-less" prevented the condition for automotive parts from matching in the fallback search mechanism.
   - **Fix**: Modified the `_get_fallback_results` method in `utils/api_client.py` to preprocess the query by replacing hyphens with spaces and checking for both versions.

2. **LLM Service Validation Issues (Fixed)**:
   - **Problem**: The code was checking if the LLM service exists but not if it's properly enabled.
   - **Root Cause**: Missing validation in the `_get_search_terms` and `generate_tariff_explanation` methods in `utils/product_analyzer.py`.
   - **Fix**: Added proper validation to ensure the LLM service is only used when it's properly enabled.

3. **Search Results Table Issue (Fixed)**:
   - **Problem**: The search results table wasn't displaying relevant results for any search.
   - **Root Cause**: The API search wasn't including the specific HTS codes for products, and there was too much hardcoding of specific product categories.
   - **Fix**: 
     - Modified the `enhance_search_query` method in `utils/llm_service.py` to ask the LLM to identify appropriate HTS codes for products.
     - Updated the prompt to include a new section: "HTS_CODES: Provide 2-3 specific HTS codes that would be appropriate for this product".
     - Added code to parse the HTS codes from the LLM response and include them in the search terms.
     - Removed hardcoded product category detection in favor of using the LLM to identify product categories and suggest appropriate HTS codes.
     - Implemented a new `_filter_results_for_relevance` method in `utils/product_analyzer.py` to filter out irrelevant search results.
     - Updated the `_sort_results` method to take into account the relevance score when sorting the results.

4. **Test Scripts Created**:
   - Created `simple_test.py`, `simple_test_focused.py`, `test_api_url.py`, `simple_bumper_test.py`, and `test_bumper_search.py` to verify the fixes and test different aspects of the search functionality.

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Testing**: Finish testing all aspects of the POC, including the fixed search functionality.
2. **Document Findings**: Record any additional issues or improvements.
3. **Prioritize Enhancements**: Identify key areas for improvement.
4. **Plan Next Iteration**: Define scope for the next development phase.

The POC is functional and demonstrates the core capabilities of the TariffDoc AI concept. The recent fixes have improved the robustness of the search functionality, particularly for handling hyphenated terms, properly validating the LLM service, and using the LLM to identify product categories and suggest appropriate HTS codes. These changes should provide a better user experience with more relevant search results.
